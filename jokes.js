var jokeData = require('./jokes.json');


// To passs the first test.. make your constructor function..
// and export it.

// To pass the second test, add a function to the constructor
// through the prototype chain. It will need to return an array
// of jokes using jokeData... Make sure you console.log(jokeData)
// and understand what type of data it is. Hint: The array we
// care about is hiding in there somewhere.


// The easiest way to pass test 4, is to make a new array with
// only the data we care about. Hint: See examples.js

// Don't over complicate test 5... just google js how to get
// random item from array.

// Test 7, 8.. It's not that hard to FIND something in an array.
// hint hint.. find it..
